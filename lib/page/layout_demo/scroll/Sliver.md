Completion
Congratulations! üëç You have reached the end of the workshop.

In this workshop we

learned how to build scroll views efficiently, using lazy loading for our scrollable
converted our scroll view to work directly with slivers
explored the SliverAppBar and how it is complimented by the FlexibleSpaceBar widget.
There are a lot more slivers to explore, like SliverGrid and SliverPadding. Many are the sliver versions of common box widgets, like:

Box Widget	Sliver Widget
ListView	SliverList
GridView	SliverGrid
Padding	SliverPadding
AnimatedList	SliverAnimatedList
FadeTransition	SliverFadeTransition
IgnorePointer	SliverIgnorePointer
All sliver widgets are prefixed with Sliver.
